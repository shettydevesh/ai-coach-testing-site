# AI Coach A/B Testing Website

This project is a Streamlit web application designed to perform A/B testing between the outputs of two AI language models, Claude and GPT. The primary goal is to evaluate the performance and compare the responses generated by these models, while also collecting user feedback to identify areas for improvement.

## Features

- **A/B Testing Interface:** The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can submit queries and receive responses from both Claude and GPT models side by side for easy comparison.
- **User Feedback Collection:** After a certain number of queries, users are prompted to provide feedback on the model outputs, enabling the collection of valuable insights for model enhancement.
- **Visual Comparison:** The application displays the outputs from Claude and GPT in a visually appealing and organized manner, making it easy to analyze and compare the responses.
- **Loader and Success Indicators:** A loader is shown while the models are processing the query, and a success message is displayed once the responses are fetched, providing a smooth user experience.
